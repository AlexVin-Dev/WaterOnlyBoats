# WaterOnlyBoats  
The **WaterOnlyBoats** plugin adds control over the placement of boats in your world. It blocks players' attempts to place boats on any surface other than water. This helps keep the game realistic and prevents boats from being used to create unintended structures on land.

Main features:
* Prohibits the installation of boats on blocks other than water
* Customizable list of worlds with restrictions
* Customizable list of boat types
* Custom error message.
